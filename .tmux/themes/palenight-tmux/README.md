# palenight tmux colour theme
A tmux theme with dark colours inspired by the drewtempelmeyer/palenight.vim theme for Vim/Neovim.
Much of the work was forked from the mbdimitrova/tmux-wolfpack theme.

## Installation
You can install the theme in two ways:

### Add to your .tmux.conf
Append the content of `palenight.tmux` to `.tmux.conf`:

```cat theme/palenight.tmux >> ~/.tmux.conf```

### [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
Add as a plugin to the list of TPM plugins in `.tmux.conf`:

```set -g @plugin 'tonylambiris/palenight-tmux'```

Hit `prefix + I` to fetch the plugin and source it.
