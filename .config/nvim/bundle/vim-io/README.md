# vim-io

This project adds support for the [Io language][io] for the Vim editor. It 
handles syntax highlighting for `*.io` files.

## Thanks

The original syntax highlighting file for Vim was taken from the
[Io repository] [io-vim] and was originally written by Scott Dunlop, with fixes from Manpreet Singh, Jonathan Wright and Erik Garrison.
